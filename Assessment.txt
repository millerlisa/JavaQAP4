1. In total, unsure. Intently, 4 solid hours of correcting written code and adding to repository for submission.

2. I used lectures, copilot and chatGPT. I am happy that I was able to spot incorrect code by copilot so I am not completely in the dark.

3. No friends were involved in this one.

4. I did not have to ask an in structor or TA this time.

5. I would love to say this was easy and I totally understood it but I'm still struggling with some of the logic and problem solving. Most of the syntax I understand. I recognize that is because I'm not practicing as much as I should, or as much as I would if I wasn't working multiple jobs. 

Note: I do appreciate how you teach us these new concepts and go through multiple examples in class.
